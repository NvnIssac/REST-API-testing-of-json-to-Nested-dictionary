# REST-API-testing-of-json-to-Nested-dictionary
REST API Python Flask Implementation for json to nested dictionary based on nesting order as arguments
Create a REST service from the previous task. Make sure your methods support basic auth. Input json should be received via POST request, nesting parameters should be specified as request parameters.


Implementation:
Json File has been provided as input in the Python Script.

I have tested with Valid Json, Invalid syntax Error Json and Keyword not matching in Json.
